Business Need
You are a data scientist at Adey Innovations Inc., a top company in the financial technology sector. Your company focuses on solutions for e-commerce and banking. Your task is to improve the detection of fraud cases for e-commerce transactions and bank credit transactions. This project aims to create accurate and strong fraud detection models that handle the unique challenges of both types of transaction data. It also includes using geolocation analysis and transaction pattern recognition to improve detection.

Good fraud detection greatly improves transaction security. By using advanced machine learning models and detailed data analysis, Adey Innovations Inc. can spot fraudulent activities more accurately. This helps prevent financial losses and builds trust with customers and financial institutions. A well-designed fraud detection system also makes real-time monitoring and reporting more efficient, allowing businesses to act quickly and reduce risks.

This project will involve:

Analyzing and preprocessing transaction data.
Creating and engineering features that help identify fraud patterns.
Building and training machine learning models to detect fraud.
Evaluating model performance and making necessary improvements.
Deploying the models for real-time fraud detection and setting up monitoring for continuous improvement.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will be using the following datasets:

1. Fraud_Data.csv

Includes e-commerce transaction data aimed at identifying fraudulent activities.

user_id: A unique identifier for the user who made the transaction.
signup_time: The timestamp when the user signed up.
purchase_time: The timestamp when the purchase was made.
purchase_value: The value of the purchase in dollars.
device_id: A unique identifier for the device used to make the transaction.
source: The source through which the user came to the site (e.g., SEO, Ads).
browser: The browser used to make the transaction (e.g., Chrome, Safari).
sex: The gender of the user (M for male, F for female).
age: The age of the user.
ip_address: The IP address from which the transaction was made.
class: The target variable where 1 indicates a fraudulent transaction and 0 indicates a non-fraudulent transaction.

2. IpAddress_to_Country.csv

Maps IP addresses to countries

lower_bound_ip_address: The lower bound of the IP address range.
upper_bound_ip_address: The upper bound of the IP address range.
country: The country corresponding to the IP address range.

3. creditcard.csv

Contains bank transaction data specifically curated for fraud detection analysis. 

Time: The number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
V1 to V28: These are anonymized features resulting from a PCA transformation. Their exact nature is not disclosed for privacy reasons, but they represent the underlying patterns in the data.
Amount: The transaction amount in dollars.
Class: The target variable where 1 indicates a fraudulent transaction and 0 indicates a non-fraudulent transaction.



Task 1 - Data Analysis and Preprocessing
- Handle Missing Values
    Impute or drop missing values
- Data Cleaning
    Remove duplicates
    Correct data types
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Univariate analysis
    Bivariate analysis
- Merge Datasets for Geolocation Analysis
    Convert IP addresses to integer format
    Merge Fraud_Data.csv with IpAddress_to_Country.csv
- Feature Engineering
    Transaction frequency and velocity for Fraud_Data.csv
    Time-Based features for Fraud_Data.csv
        hour_of _day
        day_of_week
- Normalization and Scaling
- Encode Categorical Features













Task 2 - Model Building and Training 
Data Preparation:
Feature and Target Separation [‘Class’(creditcard), ‘class’(Fraud_Data)]
Train-Test Split 
Model Selection
Use several models to compare performance, including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Model Training and Evaluation
Training models for both credit card and fraud-data datasets.
MLOps Steps
Versioning and Experiment Tracking
Use tools like MLflow to track experiments, log parameters, metrics, and version models.








Task 3 - Model Explainability
Model explainability is crucial for understanding, trust, and debugging in machine learning models. You will use SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to interpret the models you built for fraud detection.

Using SHAP for Explainability
SHAP values provide a unified measure of feature importance, explaining the contribution of each feature to the prediction.
Installing SHAP
pip install shap
Explaining a Model with SHAP
SHAP Plots
Summary Plot: Provides an overview of the most important features.
Force Plot: Visualizes the contribution of features for a single prediction.
Dependence Plot: This shows the relationship between a feature and the model output.
Using LIME for Explainability
LIME explains individual predictions by approximating the model locally with an interpretable model.
Installing LIME
pip install lime
Explaining a Model with LIME
LIME Plots
Feature Importance Plot: Shows the most influential features for a specific prediction.






Task 4 - Model Deployment and API Development
Setting Up the Flask API
Create the Flask Application
Create a new directory for your project:
Create a Python script serve_model.py to serve the model using Flask
Create a requirements.txt file to list dependencies
API Development
Define API Endpoints
Test the API
Dockerizing the Flask Application
Create a Dockerfile in the same directory
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . .

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Make port 5000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 5000

# Run serve_model.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "serve_model.py"]

Build and Run the Docker Container
Build the Docker image
docker build -t fraud-detection-model.
Run the Docker container
docker run -p 5000:5000 fraud-detection-model
Integrate logging Flask-Logging to track incoming requests, errors, and fraud predictions for continuous monitoring.






Task 5 - Build a Dashboard with Flask and Dash


Create an interactive dashboard using Dash for visualizing fraud Insights from your data. The Flask backend will serve data from the datasets, while Dash will be used to visualize insights.

Add  a Flask Endpoint  that reads fraud data from a CSV file and serves summary statistics and fraud trends through API endpoints.
Use Dash to handle the frontend visualizations.
Dashboard Insights  can be:
Display total transactions, fraud cases, and fraud percentages in simple summary boxes.
Displays a line chart showing the number of detected fraud cases over time, using the data served by the Flask backend.
Analyze where fraud is occurring geographically
Show a bar chart comparing the number of fraud cases across different devices and browsers.
Show a chart comparing the number of fraud cases across different devices and browsers.
